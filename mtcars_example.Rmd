## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
data(mtcars)

mtcars$gear <- factor(mtcars$gear)

model <- lm(mpg ~ wt * gear, data = mtcars)
summary(model)

mtcars$int <- interaction(mtcars$gear, mtcars$wt)
```

wt:gear4 & wt:gear5 is how you should adjust the slope. 

__Estimate for gear 4__:
For the intercept of gear4 take the intercept & add the estimate of having four gears (gear4 = 14.098). 
For the slope of gear4, take the slope of wt and add the *wt:gear4*

quit

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
